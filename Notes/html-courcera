Q1:

I'm trying to prove my HTML file with the PHP code written by Dr. Rossiter. I'm using POST method for handling the form, but the PHP code shows these:
QUERY_STRING is
REQUEST_URI is /~rossiter/cgi-bin/show_everything.php
A1:
If you use the POST method, you will see nothing.
If you use the GET method when submitting the form, you will see everything you submitted by the form in the QUERY_STRING and the REQUEST_URI.
